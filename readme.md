# How to run
To obtain the results given in the report, the only thing that is required is to run the python file **Stop-and-wait_protocol.py**. 
# Changing parameters
It is possible to only run part of the code by changing the boolean values given after the functions:
```python
give_an_example = True
do_experiment_1 = True
do_experiment_2 = True
do_experiment_3 = True
```
It is also possible to create a new expirement by running the main function directly:
```
main(n = 4, M_size = 4, p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.2, linear = False)
```
The parameters are explained in the docstring in the code.
